# Data Structures and Algorithms

![alt text](./misc/go_witchlearning.svg)

The following is a repository created by myself in order to master the GO programming language by implementing classic Data Structures and Algorithms. 
Any comments or tips would be appreciated!


## LinkedList
- Singly Linked List with Size optimization 
- Doubly Linked list with Tail Pointer, Size field, and Prev Node optimization 

## Queues
- Basic Queue extending the doubly linked list implementation

## Stacks 

- Basic Stack extending the doubly linked list implementation
## Trees 
- Binary Search Tree implemented via node Objects
- Red and Black Trees implemented via node Objects 
- Tries implemented via node Objects 

## Hash Table
- Basic Hash Symbol table implementation using seperate chaining method 

## Graphs
- Bidirectional Graph implementing Breath First Search and Depth First Search Algorithms

## Sorts 
- Merge Sort Algorithm on a standard array (Go Slice)
- Quick Sort Algorithm on s standard array (Go Slice)
